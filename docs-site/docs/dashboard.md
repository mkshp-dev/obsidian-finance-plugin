## 📝 Usage Tips

- **Refresh Data**: The dashboard automatically refreshes when you modify transactions, but you can also force a refresh if you've edited the file externally.
- **Currency Conversion**: The dashboard uses the price database to estimate values in your reporting currency (usually USD or your local currency). Ensure your prices are up-to-date for accurate Net Worth calculations.
