# Journal Tab

The **Journal Tab** provides a comprehensive, raw view of your Beancount ledger—similar to the Fava web interface.

## 📋 Features

### Complete Entry Stream
Unlike the Transactions tab, the Journal view shows **all** entry types:
- **Transactions**: Standard double-entry records
- **Notes**: Descriptive notes attached to accounts
- **Balance Assertions**: Balance checks/reconciliations
- **Other Directives**: Any other Beancount directives (pads, documents, etc.)

### Full Management Capabilities
- **View Details**: Click any entry to see full information including metadata
- **Edit**: Right-click or click the edit button to modify an entry
- **Delete**: Remove entries with confirmation to prevent accidents
- **Search**: Full-text search across all fields (date, payee, narration, accounts)

### Advanced Filtering
- **Date Range**: Filter entries by start and end dates
- **Account Filter**: Show entries involving specific accounts
- **Entry Type**: Filter by transaction, note, balance assertion, etc.
- **Live Search**: Instant results as you type
