2. **Set Beancount File Path**: Enter the absolute path to your main `.beancount` file
   - Windows: `C:\Users\YourName\Documents\finances.beancount`

## Python Backend (Auto-starting)

The **Journal tab** uses a Python backend that **starts automatically** when needed.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8+** installed and available in your system PATH
2. **Beancount** package: `pip install beancount`

The backend will automatically install Flask and flask-cors when first started.

### How It Works

- When you open the Journal tab, the backend starts automatically as a child process
- No manual commands or scripts needed
- The backend runs on `http://localhost:5001` by default
- Backend stops automatically when you close Obsidian

### Backend Features

- **Automatic Process Management**: Starts and stops with the plugin
- **Complete Transaction Parsing**: Full Beancount file parsing with all postings, metadata, and tags
- **Server-side Filtering**: High-performance filtering by date, account, payee, tags, and search terms
- **Auto-reload**: Reload Beancount files without restarting

### Troubleshooting

If the Journal tab shows "Backend API Starting..." for more than 30 seconds:

## 🔍 Using BQL Queries

The plugin includes powerful **BQL (Beancount Query Language)** functionality with two distinct modes for different use cases.

### 📊 **BQL Code Blocks** - For Detailed Analysis

Create formatted tables with full query results:

1. **Insert Code Block**: Use the command `Insert BQL Query Block` or manually type:
   ````markdown
   ```bql
   SELECT account GROUP BY account ORDER BY account
   ```
   ````

2. **Interactive Results**: 
   - **Refresh** (⟳): Re-run query with latest data
   - **Copy** (📋): Copy raw CSV results to clipboard
   - **Export** (📤): Download results as CSV file
   - **View Query**: Toggle query visibility

### 💰 **Inline BQL Queries** - For Live Financial Data ⭐ **NEW**

Embed live financial values directly in your text using single backticks:

#### **Direct Queries:**
```markdown
My current net worth is `bql:SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ '^Assets'`

Today I have `bql:SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ 'Checking'` in my checking account.
```

#### **Shorthand System:**
First, configure shortcuts in your template file, then use them:

```markdown
My total worth: `bql-sh:WORTH`
Checking balance: `bql-sh:CHECKING`  
Monthly expenses: `bql-sh:EXPENSES_MTD`
```

### ⚙️ **Template File System**

All shortcuts are defined in a **user-customizable template file**:

1. **Configure Template Path**: Settings → Finance Plugin → BQL Shortcuts Template Path
2. **Example Template Format**:
   ```markdown
   ## WORTH: Total net worth in USD
   ```bql-shorthand
   SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ '^Assets'
   ```
   
   ## CHECKING: Checking account balance
   ```bql-shorthand
   SELECT convert(sum(position), 'USD') WHERE account ~ '^Assets:Checking'
   ```
   ```

3. **Completely Customizable**: Create any shortcuts you want with your preferred currencies and account patterns

### Common BQL Query Examples

**List All Accounts:**
```bql
SELECT account GROUP BY account ORDER BY account
```

**Recent Transactions:**
```bql
SELECT date, payee, narration, account, position ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 20
```

**Account Balances:**
```bql
SELECT account, sum(position) GROUP BY account ORDER BY account
```

**Asset Accounts:**
```bql
SELECT account, sum(position) WHERE account ~ '^Assets' GROUP BY account
```

**Income This Year:**
```bql
SELECT account, sum(position) WHERE account ~ '^Income' AND year = YEAR(TODAY()) GROUP BY account
```

**Monthly Expenses:**
```bql
SELECT year, month, sum(position) WHERE account ~ '^Expenses' GROUP BY year, month ORDER BY year DESC, month DESC
```

### 🎯 **Use Cases**

**Code Blocks** - Perfect for:
- Financial analysis and reporting
- Detailed account breakdowns  
- Data export for spreadsheets
- Complex multi-column queries

**Inline Queries** - Perfect for:
- Daily journal entries: "Spent `bql-sh:DAILY_EXPENSES` today"
- Quick financial summaries: "Net worth: `bql-sh:WORTH`"  
- Status updates: "Emergency fund: `bql-sh:EMERGENCY_FUND`"
- Goal tracking: "Savings progress: `bql-sh:SAVINGS_GOAL`"

### BQL Integration Benefits

- **Live Data**: Always shows current data from your Beancount ledger
- **Template System**: No built-in defaults - everything is user-defined
- **Note-Taking Workflow**: Perfect for financial journaling and analysis
- **No External Tools**: Execute queries directly within Obsidian
- **Dual Modes**: Choose the right format for your needs
- **Custom Shortcuts**: Create personalized financial shortcuts

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Backend Issues

If the Journal tab shows "Backend API Starting..." for more than 30 seconds:

1. **Check Python Installation**: Ensure `python3` or `python` command works in terminal
2. **Install Beancount**: Run `pip install beancount`
3. **Check Console**: Open Developer Tools (Ctrl+Shift+I) for error messages
4. **Verify File Path**: Ensure Beancount file path is correct in plugin settings

**Note**: Other tabs work independently. The Journal tab requires Python 3.8+ and Beancount, but handles all setup automatically.

### Liabilities & Net Worth Presentation

Important: Beancount often stores liabilities as negative numbers (this is standard). To make the Snapshot/Sidebar clearer for users:

- Liabilities are displayed as a positive magnitude in the UI (e.g. `200 USD` instead of `-200 USD`).
- Net Worth is calculated as Assets - Liabilities (where Liabilities is treated as the positive magnitude). The UI preserves overpaid/credit balances correctly (if a liability becomes positive in Beancount, the net worth calculation accounts for that).

This presentation makes the Snapshot easier to read while preserving accounting semantics under the hood.

Selecting a Beancount file from the vault

If your `.beancount` file lives inside your Obsidian vault, you can choose it directly from the plugin Settings using the "Choose from vault" button next to the Beancount file path input. The plugin will set the absolute filesystem path (so external tools like `bean-query` can read it) and validate the file automatically.

### Yahoo Finance Symbol Search

The **Commodities tab** includes a simplified Yahoo Finance integration that helps you find and configure ticker symbols for automated price fetching.

#### How It Works

1. **Browse Financial Websites**: Click buttons to open major financial websites in new tabs
   - **Yahoo Finance** - https://finance.yahoo.com/
   - **Google Finance** - https://www.google.com/finance/
   - **Bloomberg** - https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/
   - **MarketWatch** - https://www.marketwatch.com/
   - **Investing.com** - https://www.investing.com/
   - **Morningstar** - https://www.morningstar.com/

2. **Find Your Symbol**: Search for your desired stock, ETF, or crypto on any of these sites and copy the ticker symbol

3. **Quick Examples**: Use pre-populated examples organized by category:
   - **Popular Stocks**: AAPL, GOOGL, MSFT, AMZN, TSLA, NVDA, META, NFLX
   - **ETFs**: SPY, QQQ, VTI, VOO, IVV  
   - **Cryptocurrency**: BTC-USD, ETH-USD, ADA-USD, SOL-USD

4. **Configure Price Source**: Enter the symbol manually or click an example to automatically generate the Beancount price metadata in the format `USD:yahoo/SYMBOL`

#### Benefits

- **No API Dependencies**: No API keys, rate limits, or CORS issues
- **Always Up-to-Date**: Uses official financial websites with the most current symbol information
- **User-Controlled**: You research and verify symbols on professional financial sites
- **Educational**: Learn about different financial data sources and their coverage
- **Flexible**: Works with any symbol that Yahoo Finance supports for price fetching

This approach provides a reliable, user-friendly way to configure automated price sources for your Beancount commodities without the complexity of API management.
