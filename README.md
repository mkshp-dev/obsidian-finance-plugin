## 🔧 Requirements

This plugin integrates with your existing Beancount setup:

1. **Python 3.8+**
2. **Beancount v3+**: Install via `pip install beancount`
3. **bean-query**: Command-line tool for querying Beancount files (`pip install beanquery`)
4. **bean-price** *(optional)*: For automatic commodity price fetching (`pip install beanprice`)
5. **WSL Support** *(optional)*: Full compatibility for Windows users running Beancount in WSL

> **Note:** `bean-query` and `bean-price` are separate packages from Beancount itself and require their own `pip install` commands.
