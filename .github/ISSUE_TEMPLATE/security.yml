        ## ⚠️ Security Disclosure Policy
        
        **IMPORTANT:** If you've discovered a **critical security vulnerability** that could compromise user data or systems, please DO NOT create a public issue.
        
        Instead, please report it privately by:
        1. Using GitHub's [Security Advisory](https://github.com/mkshp-dev/obsidian-finance-plugin/security/advisories/new) feature (preferred)
        2. Or emailing the maintainers directly (check README for contact info)
        
        This template is for **non-critical security concerns** that don't pose immediate risk.
